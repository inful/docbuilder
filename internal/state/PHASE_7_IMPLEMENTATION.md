# Phase 7: Service Orchestration and Integration Modernization – Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 3, 2025

## Overview
This phase modernized the service/orchestration layer of the DocBuilder daemon, ensuring robust integration with the new type-safe state subsystem. The service layer now provides:
- Clean, modular orchestration of state operations
- Type-safe interfaces for all state, repository, and model interactions
- Comprehensive health, lifecycle, and maintenance operations
- Full test coverage and legacy compatibility

## Key Changes

### 1. Modern Service Layer

- `StateService` wraps the composable state stores and exposes a clean, testable service interface.
- All service methods use strongly-typed models and Option/Result types.
- Dependency injection and testability are supported throughout.

### 2. Integration and Health

- Service lifecycle (start/stop), health checks, backup, migration, and maintenance operations are implemented and tested.
- The service layer integrates seamlessly with the new repository/model subsystem.

### 3. Testing and Legacy Compatibility

- All service/orchestration logic is covered by comprehensive tests in `state_test.go`.
- Legacy compatibility is validated via migration adapter tests.

## Outcome
- The orchestration/service layer is robust, modular, and ready for further integration or extension.
- All tests pass, and no regressions were introduced.
- The codebase is now fully modernized through the service layer.
